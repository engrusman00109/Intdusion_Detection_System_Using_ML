# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Optimization

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using the NUSW-NB-15 benchmark dataset. The objective is to classify network traffic as normal or abnormal (binary classification) and classify specific types of attacks (multi-class classification) with enhanced accuracy and control overfitting using machine learning techniques.

## Project Flow

1. **Dataset**: Utilized the NUSW-NB-15 dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset in network intrusion detection, for training and testing the models. This dataset contains labeled network traffic data, crucial for training supervised machine learning models.

2. **Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Preprocessing**: Before modeling, the dataset underwent preprocessing steps. This included handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring data consistency. Standardization or normalization techniques were applied to scale features to a uniform range, which helps models converge faster during training and improves prediction accuracy.
   
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA was performed to gain insights into the dataset. This involved visualizing data distributions, examining feature correlations, and exploring class distributions. EDA helps in understanding the underlying patterns in the data, identifying potential challenges, and guiding feature engineering efforts.

3. **Feature Engineering and Selection**:
   - **Feature Engineering**: New features were created from existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the models. Feature engineering involved transformations, aggregations, or interactions between features. This step aimed to extract relevant information from raw data and improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
   
   - **Feature Selection using ANOVA F-Statistic**: Feature selection techniques such as ANOVA F-statistic were applied to select the most significant features for modeling. ANOVA helps in identifying features that have the strongest impact on the target variable, thus reducing dimensionality and improving model performance by focusing on relevant features.

4. **Modeling**:
   - Three models were implemented for binary classification:
     - **Logistic Regression**: A linear model used for predicting binary outcomes. It provides a probabilistic interpretation of predictions and is effective when the relationship between features and the target variable is linear.
     - **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between features. It works well with high-dimensional data and is computationally efficient.
     - **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, each correcting its predecessor. It typically performs well in classification tasks but can overfit if not carefully tuned.

   - Techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, regularization (e.g., L1 and L2 regularization), and ensemble methods (e.g., XGBoost) were employed to enhance model accuracy and control overfitting. Model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess model performance.

5. **Deployment using Django**:
   - **Integration with Django**: The trained machine learning models were integrated into a web application using Django framework. Django provides a robust environment for deploying machine learning models as web services or applications, enabling real-time predictions.
   - A web interface was created to interact with the deployed models. Users could input data through the interface, and the models would predict whether the network traffic is normal or abnormal, or classify the specific type of attack.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The project successfully achieved its objectives of enhancing prediction accuracy and speed in intrusion detection using machine learning techniques. By leveraging preprocessing, feature engineering, and advanced modeling, the models demonstrated improved performance in classifying network traffic and detecting various types of attacks.
   - The deployment of models using Django ensures scalability and accessibility, making the IDS system suitable for real-time monitoring and decision-making in network security applications.
